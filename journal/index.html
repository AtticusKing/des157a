        <h3>Form Design Research</h3>
        <p>As a Graphic Designer, this article on form design resonates with me in terms of the balance between
            aesthetics and functionality, as it can be a tough mental battle between artistic creativity and a good user
            experience (UX). For example, the emphasis on minimizing input fields and following the "Less is More"
            theory aligns with the design principle of simplicity, ensuring a visually clean and efficient form. The
            article's author, Salim Ansari, cautions against assumptions and highlights the need for thorough user
            research, a principle applicable to graphic design as well, where understanding the target audience is
            absolutely crucial. Additionally, I feel that the mention of accessibility considerations serves as a
            valuable reminder to designers to create designs that cater to users of all abilities.</p>

        <p>The UC Davis library website exemplifies best practices of form creation by understanding the needs of the
            user and categorizing the website first into a number of spaces, using icons as cleanly styled buttons.
            Within these, there is a general search bar with an “advanced search” option and a simple checkbox for
            searching in UC Davis libraries only. Ultimately it exemplifies best practices because it is so easily
            navigated.</p>
