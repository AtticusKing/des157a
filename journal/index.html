                <p class="a6" id="p1">One key takeaway for me was Dori's discussion on UI positions, particularly in mobile games. His point about considering the comfort-to-reach area for interactive elements like store buttons and ads makes perfect sense. It's crucial to strategically place these elements where users are most likely to interact with them, maximizing monetization without compromising user experience. The section on sliders also caught my attention, as it addresses a common challenge in game design: presenting a lot of content within limited screen real estate. Dori's tips on making partly visible items within sliders and animating their launch to guide users are practical and insightful strategies that I'll definitely keep in mind for future projects.</p>

                <p class="a4" id="p1">I am most excited about this image because it is so ambiguous and mysterious. My
                    project is built around contextualizing AI rendered images with a loose lore framework so an image
                    with so little context such as a giant bastion rising above the jungle is great for story telling.
                    One thing you might not know when looking at this image for the first time is how much trial and
                    error is involved in getting a single perfect AI image.</p>

                <p class="a5" id="p1">This image taken by Lupe Alvarez seems to have been captured in Korea during a
                    trip, the project looks like a travel log. The most interesting part is the chaos of the image, it
                    feels alive and busy, from the crowd in the alleyway to the bus half entering the frame. The most
                    mysterious aspect is was this documentation of a trip, or did Lupe spend time living in Korea?</p>

                <p class="a3" id="p1">I think the concept of slowing down and closely reading images and text is great
                    in
                    this world of increasing speeds. Everything is built around efficiency, including what we read in
                    the
                    form of tweets, texts, or captions. So to go back and retrain the ability to calmly and carefully
                    intake
                    information is a good idea. I found myself making a quick initial guess at each of the 10 images in
                    the
                    article, before taking another 20-30 seconds to fully process the scene and make a second guess that
                    each time turned out to be far more accurate to the actual background of the photo.</p>

                <h3 id="title2">Best Practices for Overlays</h3>
                <p class="a2" id="p1">The article on the overuse of overlays by Nielsen Norman Group sheds light on the
                    challenges and considerations in implementing overlays and lightboxes. The writing describes well
                    the
                    delicate balance designers must strike between enhancing user experience and avoiding pitfalls that
                    can
                    lead to frustration and decreased task completion. The great example of Apple's modification to
                    eliminate the overlay in their MobileMe support section underscores the importance of reassessing
                    design
                    choices when overlays hinder user interaction. It serves as a reminder that while overlays can offer
                    elegant solutions, they should not be a default choice and require careful consideration. I think
                    this
                    article serves as a great guide for new designers like myself, urging us to think critically and
                    mindfully about the impact of overlays on user experience.</p>

                <h3 id="title1">Form Design Best Practices</h3>
                <p class="a1" id="p1">As a Graphic Designer, this article on form design resonates with me in terms of
                    the
                    balance between
                    aesthetics and functionality, as it can be a tough mental battle between artistic creativity and a
                    good
                    user
                    experience (UX). For example, the emphasis on minimizing input fields and following the "Less is
                    More"
                    theory aligns with the design principle of simplicity, ensuring a visually clean and efficient form.
                    The
                    article's author, Salim Ansari, cautions against assumptions and highlights the need for thorough
                    user
                    research, a principle applicable to graphic design as well, where understanding the target audience
                    is
                    absolutely crucial. Additionally, I feel that the mention of accessibility considerations serves as
                    a
                    valuable reminder to designers to create designs that cater to users of all abilities.</p>

                <p class="a1" id="p2">The UC Davis library website exemplifies best practices of form creation by
                    understanding the needs of the
                    user and categorizing the website first into a number of spaces, using icons as cleanly styled
                    buttons.
                    Within these, there is a general search bar with an “advanced search” option and a simple checkbox
                    for
                    searching in UC Davis libraries only. Ultimately it exemplifies best practices because it is so
                    easily
                    navigated.</p>
