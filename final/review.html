            <p>I plan to add a brief summary at the top of the page on a solid background. When the website is loaded it
            will begin with this summary of the information, perhaps a timeline or description of the project. Then when
            someone scrolls down it begins the zoom process that Iâ€™ve already coded and implemented. When in the focus
            state (zoomed in) there will now also be the option to open an overlay with extended information.</p>
